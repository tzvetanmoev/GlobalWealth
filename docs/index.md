## About

Here we use PPP-adjusted data on real incomes from the [Global Consumption and Income Project](http://gcip.info/) to build an interactive visualisation demonstrating the changing shape of global income since 1980.

You can also download the data here in <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jackblun/Globalinc/master/GCIPrawdata.xlsx" download ="download"> xlsx </a> or <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jackblun/Globalinc/master/GCIPrawdata.csv" download ="download"> csv </a> formats.
 
Taller blocks correspond to higher incomes. Countries with larger populations are assigned more blocks. Colours correspond to how rich the country is in 1980, with poorer countries shaded red and richer countries shaded green. Countries are ordered according to mean income level in each year, while holding colours fixed from the 1980 levels. Therefore with these figures we can see inequality within and across countries over time as well as changes in average income.

20th April 2019 - While there have been data revisions to GCIP, we are for now retaining our original data in the construction of graphs here. We cannot extend the time series beyond 2014 and will keep this under review.
